Each ADR follows this naming: `NNNN-decision-title.md` where NNNN is a sequential number.

## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when:
- Choosing between multiple valid architectural approaches
- Making trade-offs (performance vs. accuracy, simplicity vs. flexibility)
- Decisions that affect multiple features
- Choices that are difficult to reverse later
- Technology selection with significant impact
